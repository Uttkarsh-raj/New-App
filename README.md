# News App
<br>
<h3 align ="center">Problem Statement </h3>
Develop a News App with Firebase Integration that provides a seamless user experience. The app should feature a visually appealing UI with the ability to switch between grid view and list view for news articles. Use a state management tool like Provider, Bloc, or Riverpod to manage the app's state effectively. Additionally, ensure that the app can store some news data locally to allow users to view news articles even when there is no internet connection or network failure.

  There are many great README templates available on GitHub;however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this one. I wanted to create a README template which satisfies the project.
  
Here's why:

- A project that solves a problem and helps others.
- One shouldn't be doing the same task over and over like creating a README from scratch.
- You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So i'll be  adding more in the near future.You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
